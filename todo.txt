TODO:

- COMPLETE - change debug screens (depth, normals etc) to be full screen insted of quarter screen
------------ test sphere intersection in uniform grid
------------ add vao/vbo for rendering frustrum
------------ add debug screen that gives a top down view (will allow us to see frustrum and frustrum culling in the future and collider intersection tests etc)
------------ add debug screen for displaying colliders and/or bounding spheres for testing ray casting and collider intersection
------------ test and fix bugs to get ray casting working with uniform grid.
------------ get uniform grid to test against spheres, bounds, and triangles properly
------------ write algorithm to calculate bounding sphere of a triangle
------------ add layers to colliders and add in frustrum culling
------------ perform camera frustum culling
- COMPLETE - add parent to transforms
------------ create scene graph from hierarchy of transforms
------------ render using scene graph for non-static meshes
- COMPLETE - add text debug information about number of drawcalls
------------ create raytracer renderer
------------ create deferred renderer
------------ call all glDelete* methods 
- COMPLETE - rewrite obj parser to allow for multiple materials
- COMPLETE - change engine code to allow for multiple materials
- COMPLETE - change editor code to allow for serialization of mesh renderers with multiple materials
------------ figure out directional light bug that causes first cascade to be dark
- COMPLETE - combine all light types into one Light class
------------ write material mtl parser for generating json material files from mtl files
- COMPLETE - get minimal imgui editor project set up and working
