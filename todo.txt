TODO:

- COMPLETE - change debug screens (depth, normals etc) to be full screen insted of quarter screen
------------ test sphere intersection in uniform grid
------------ add vao/vbo for rendering frustrum
------------ add debug screen that gives a top down view (will allow us to see frustrum and frustrum culling in the future and collider intersection tests etc)
------------ add debug screen for displaying colliders and/or bounding spheres for testing ray casting and collider intersection
------------ test and fix bugs to get ray casting working with uniform grid.
------------ get uniform grid to test against spheres, bounds, and triangles properly
------------ write algorithm to calculate bounding sphere of a triangle
------------ add layers to colliders and add in frustrum culling
------------ perform camera frustum culling
- COMPLETE - add parent to transforms
------------ create scene graph from hierarchy of transforms
------------ render using scene graph for non-static meshes
- COMPLETE - add text debug information about number of drawcalls
------------ create raytracer renderer
------------ create deferred renderer
------------ call all glDelete* methods 
- COMPLETE - rewrite obj parser to allow for multiple materials
- COMPLETE - change engine code to allow for multiple materials
- COMPLETE - change editor code to allow for serialization of mesh renderers with multiple materials
------------ figure out directional light bug that causes first cascade to be dark
- COMPLETE - combine all light types into one Light class
------------ write material mtl parser for generating json material files from mtl files
- COMPLETE - get minimal imgui editor project set up and working
------------ add ReadMe file
------------ create editor inspector for each asset type (shader, material, mesh, texture2d, texture3d, cubemap)
- COMPLETE - implement drag and drop for meshes in editor inspector
- COMPLETE - implement drag and drop for materials in editor inspector
------------ implement drag and drop for textures in editor inspector
------------ create play mode in editor
------------ add gizmo draw pass in renderer to be used for showing gizmos in editor
------------ add pot processing render pass
------------ implement drag and drop for editor hierarchy
------------ display entity name instead of guid in editor 
- COMPLETE - implement basic undo/redo in editor
- COMPLETE - create engine build directory and bat file for debug and release builds
------------ fix scene view mouse movement as it is currently inverted and not working correctly
------------ fix undo/redo bug so that you dont have to click on the scene view for input to work
