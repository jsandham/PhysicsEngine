TODO:

 - COMPLETE - change debug screens (depth, normals etc) to be full screen insted of quarter screen
------------- test sphere intersection in uniform grid
------------- add vao/vbo for rendering frustrum
------------- add debug screen that gives a top down view (will allow us to see frustrum and frustrum culling in the future and collider intersection tests etc)
------------- add debug screen for displaying colliders and/or bounding spheres for testing ray casting and collider intersection
------------- test and fix bugs to get ray casting working with uniform grid.
------------- get uniform grid to test against spheres, bounds, and triangles properly
------------- write algorithm to calculate bounding sphere of a triangle
------------- add layers to colliders and add in frustrum culling
------------- render using scene graph for non-static meshes
------------- add text debug information about number of drawcalls
